CREATE DIV PATTERNS USING POSITION ABSOLUTE
  Create new html page should be called page2.html
  Create a css file called page2.css file and link it to the page2.html
  Create a new directory called 'style' and move all .css files into it ie style/page1.css and style/page2.css
  The page should have 6 different divs all having position absolute and their respective background colors
  Each div should have a different class name inorder to give them different styles
